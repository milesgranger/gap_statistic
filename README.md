### Methodology:

This package provides several methods to assist in choosing the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset, based on the Gap method presented in ["Estimating the number of clusters in a data set via the gap statistic"](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~gwalther/gap) (Tibshirani et al.).

The methods implemented can cluster a given dataset using a range of provided k values, and provide you with statistics that can help in choosing the right number of clusters for your dataset. Three possible methods are:

  - Taking the `k` maximizing the Gap value, which is calculated for each `k`. This, however, might not always be possible, as for many datasets this value is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
  - Taking the smallest `k` such that Gap(k) >= Gap(k+1) - s(k+1). This is the method suggested in Tibshirani et al. (consult the paper for details). The measure `diff = Gap(k) - Gap(k+1) + s(k+1)` is calculated for each `k`; the parallel here, then, is to take the smallest `k` for which `diff` is positive. Note that in some cases this can be true for the entire range of `k`.
  - Taking the `k` maximizing the Gap\* value, an alternative measure suggested in ["A comparison of Gap statistic definitions with and
with-out logarithm function"](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12172514.pdf) by Mohajer, Englmeier and Schmid. The authors claim this measure avoids the over-estimation of the number of clusters from which the original Gap statistics suffers, and can also suggest an optimal value for k for cases in which Gap cannot. They do warn, however, that the original Gap statistic performs better than Gap\* in the case of overlapped clusters, due to its tendency to overestimate the number of clusters.

Note that none of the above methods is guaranteed to find an optimal value for `k`, and that they often contradict one another. Rather, they can provide more information on which to base your choice of `k`, which should take numerous other factors into account.

### Use:

First, construct an `OptimalK` object. Optional intialization parameters are:

  - `n_jobs` - Splits computation into this number of parallel jobs. Requires choosing a parallel backend.
  - `parallel_backend` - Possible values are `joblib`, `rust` or `multiprocessing` for the built-in Python backend. If `parallel_backend == 'rust'` it will use all cores.
  - `clusterer` - Takes a custom clusterer function to be used when clustering. See the example notebook for more details.
  - `clusterer_kwargs` - Any keyword arguments to be forwarded to the custom clusterer function on each call.

An example intialization:
```python
optimalK = OptimalK(n_jobs=4, parallel_backend='joblib')
```


After the object is created, it can be called like a function, and provided with a dataset for which the optimal K is found and returned. Parameters are:

  - `X` - A pandas dataframe or numpy array of data points of shape `(n_samples, n_features)`.
  - `n_refs` - The number of random reference data sets to use as inertia reference to actual data. Optional.
  - `cluster_array` - A 1-dimensional iterable of integers; each representing `n_clusters` to try on the data. Optional.

For example:
```python
import numpy as np
n_clusters = optimalK(X, cluster_array=np.arange(1, 15))
```

After performing the search procedure, a DataFrame of gap values and other usefull statistics for  each passed cluster count is now available as the `gap_df` attributre of the `OptimalK` object:

```python
optimalK.gap_df.head()
```

The columns of the dataframe are:

  - `n_clusters` - The number of clusters for which the statistics in this row were calculated.
  - `gap_value` - The Gap value for this `n`.
  - `gap*` - The Gap\* value for this `n`.
  - `ref_dispersion_std` - The standard deviation of the reference distributions for this `n`.
  - `sk` - The standard error of the Gap statistic for this `n`.
  - `sk*` - The standard error of the Gap\* statistic for this `n`.
  - `diff` - The diff value for this `n` (see the methodology section for details).
  - `diff*` - The diff\* value for this `n` (corresponding to the diff value for Gap\*).


Additionally, the relation between the above measures and the number of clusters can be plotted by calling the `OptimalK.plot_results()` method (meant to be used inside a Jupyter Notebook or a similar IPython-based notebook), which prints four plots:

  - A plot of the Gap value versus n, the number of clusters.
  - A plot of diff versus n.
  - A plot of the Gap\* value versus n, the number of clusters.
  - A plot of the diff\* value versus n.
